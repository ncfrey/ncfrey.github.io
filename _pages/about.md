I am a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with the Lincoln Lab Supercomputing and AI groups. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. I use multiscale modeling and machine learning to design materials and molecules. I'm interested in the interface of condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, computation, and automation. I have published more than 20 scientific papers in journals like Science Advances, ACS Nano, JACS, and Chemistry of Materials.

I co-founded [AtomicAI](http://atomicai.co/) to provide data science software and consulting for bio- and nano-tech companies. We bring domain expertise in bio/nanotech and data science to help companies lower R&D costs and accelerate product development.

Previously, I was a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow in the [Shenoy group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) at [UPenn](https://www.upenn.edu/) and an affiliate scientist with Kristin Persson's [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about) group at Berkeley Lab.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
