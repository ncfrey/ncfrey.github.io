CTO & Co-Founder at [Coefficient Bio](https://coefficientbio.com/).

I’m a scientific advisor to [Atomscale](https://www.atomscale.ai/) and [Guide Labs](https://www.guidelabs.ai/).

Previously, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist and Group Leader at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) • [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/nathan-frey). I led the Foundation Models for Drug Discovery Team (Frey Lab). I was an inventor and co-lead of [Lab-in-the-loop](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.19.639050v1.abstract), a machine learning system for autonomous therapeutic antibody design. I was a postdoc at MIT, National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow at UPenn, and an affiliate scientist with the Materials Project at Berkeley Lab. I’ve published more than 20 scientific papers in journals such as _Science Advances_, _Nature Machine Intelligence_, _ACS Nano_, and _JACS_, and conference proceedings including _NeurIPS_, _ICML_, and _ICLR_. My work on discrete generative modeling of proteins won an [Outstanding Paper award at ICLR](https://blog.iclr.cc/2024/05/06/iclr-2024-outstanding-paper-awards/).
