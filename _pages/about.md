I am a PhD candidate in the [Shenoy group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I use multiscale modeling and computational techniques, including machine learning, to discover and design new materials for next-generation information processing platforms and sustainable energy applications.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
