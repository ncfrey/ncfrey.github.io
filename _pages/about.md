I am a Machine Learning Scientist and Group Leader at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) â€¢ [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/nathan-frey). At Prescient, my focus is on developing and applying machine learning methods to protein design. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I use multiscale modeling and machine learning to design materials and molecules. My research spans condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, computation, and automation. I have published more than 20 scientific papers in journals such as _Science Advances_, _ACS Nano_, _JACS_, and _Chemistry of Materials_.

I co-founded [Atomic Data Sciences](https://www.atomicdatasciences.com/) to provide data management and analysis software for nanotech companies.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) working with the [Lincoln Lab Supercomputing](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center) and [AI](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/artificial-intelligence-technology-and-systems) groups. I was a [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/About/) in the [Shenoy group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) at UPenn and an affiliate scientist with Kristin Persson's [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about) group at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
