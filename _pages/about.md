Currently building in stealth. Previously, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist and Group Leader at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) â€¢ [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/nathan-frey). I led the Foundation Models for Drug Discovery Team (Frey Lab). I was an inventor and co-lead of [Lab-in-the-loop](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.19.639050v1.abstract), a machine learning system for autonomous therapeutic antibody design. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I have published more than 20 scientific papers in journals such as _Science Advances_, _Nature Machine Intelligence_, _ACS Nano_, and _JACS_, and conference proceedings including _NeurIPS_, _ICML_, and _ICLR_. My work on discrete generative modeling of proteins won an [Outstanding Paper award at ICLR](https://blog.iclr.cc/2024/05/06/iclr-2024-outstanding-paper-awards/).

I am a scientific advisor to [Atomscale](https://www.atomscale.ai/) and [Guide Labs](https://www.guidelabs.ai/).

I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) working with the [Lincoln Lab Supercomputing](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center) and [AI](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/artificial-intelligence-technology-and-systems) groups. I was a [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/About/) at UPenn and an affiliate scientist with the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about) at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
