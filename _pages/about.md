I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) working with the [Lincoln Lab Supercomputing](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center) and [AI](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/artificial-intelligence-technology-and-systems) groups. I have a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I use multiscale modeling and machine learning to design materials and molecules. I'm interested in the interface of condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, computation, and automation. I have published more than 20 scientific papers in journals such as Science Advances, ACS Nano, JACS, and Chemistry of Materials.

I co-founded [AtomicAI](http://atomicai.co/) to provide data science software and consulting for bio- and nano-tech. We bring domain expertise in bio/nanotech and data science to lower R&D costs and accelerate product development.

Previously, I was a [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/About/) in the [Shenoy group](http://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu/) at UPenn and an affiliate scientist with Kristin Persson's [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/about) group at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch.
