## Featured Publications

### Lab-in-the-Loop: Autonomous Therapeutic Antibody Design
{: #lab-in-the-loop}

**Frey, N. C.** (co-lead), et al. (2025). "Lab-in-the-loop therapeutic antibody design with deep learning." *bioRxiv*. doi: 10.1101/2025.02.19.639050

**What it does:** Orchestrates generative ML models, multi-task property predictors, active learning, and in vitro experimentation in an iterative optimization loop. Semi-autonomous antibody design.

**Results:** Applied to four clinically relevant targets (EGFR, IL-6, HER2, OSM). Designed and tested 1,800+ unique antibody variants from leads obtained through animal immunization and immune repertoire mining.

**Impact:** End-to-end automation of antibody optimization - design, property prediction, lab testing. Practical ML-in-the-loop system for therapeutic development.

**Target audience:** Biotech researchers evaluating AI drug discovery, antibody engineers.

### Protein Discovery with Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling
{: #discrete-walk-jump}

**Frey, N. C.**, Berenberg, D., Zadorozhny, K., et al. (2024). "Protein Discovery with Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling." *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024)*. **Outstanding Paper Award** üèÜ

**Method:** Combines energy-based and score-based models. Learns smoothed energy function, samples from smoothed data manifold with Langevin MCMC, projects to true data manifold with one-step denoising.

**Results:** 97-100% of generated samples expressed and purified successfully. 70% of functional designs matched or beat known functional antibodies for binding affinity.

**Impact:** Resolves training and sampling difficulties in discrete generative models. Top 1.2% of ICLR submissions (Oral). Introduced distributional conformity score to benchmark protein generative models.

**Target audience:** ML researchers, protein engineers.

### Neural Scaling of Deep Chemical Models

**Frey, N. C.**, Soklaski, R., Axelrod, S., et al. (2023). "Neural scaling of deep chemical models." *Nature Machine Intelligence* 5(11), 1297-1305.

**Study:** First systematic investigation of neural scaling in large chemical models. Trained models with 1B+ parameters on datasets up to 10M molecules. Investigated large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for interatomic potentials.

**Results:** Neural scaling laws hold for chemistry models at massive scale. No plateau in loss improvement. Pre-training loss improved monotonically with dataset size up to 10M molecules and model size up to 1B+ parameters.

**Impact:** Chemistry and biology follow ML scaling laws. Empirical foundation for building foundation models for drug discovery. Published in Nature Machine Intelligence.

**Target audience:** AI for bio researchers, computational chemists

### Protein Design with Guided Discrete Diffusion

Gruver, N., Stanton, S., **Frey, N. C.**, Rudner, T. G., et al. (2023). "Protein Design with Guided Discrete Diffusion." *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)*.

**Method:** Guidance for discrete diffusion models following gradients in hidden states of denoising network. Enables design directly in sequence space, bypassing structure-based method limitations.

**Results:** Applied to antibody optimization for expression yield and binding affinity. 99% expression rate, 40% binding rate in exploratory in vitro experiments under locality and developability constraints.

**Impact:** Makes discrete diffusion practical for protein design. Strong performance with limited edits through novel saliency maps.

**Target audience:** ML researchers, protein designers, biotech researchers building guided generation systems.
