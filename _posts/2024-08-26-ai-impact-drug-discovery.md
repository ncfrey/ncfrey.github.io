## Executive Summary

AI/ML value in drug discovery comes from automating routine decision-making and data synthesis - the unglamorous work that slows down existing workflows. Protein binding prediction and de novo design grab headlines but miss the actual bottlenecks. This article shows where AI delivers ROI and provides a framework for evaluating investments.

## Key Insights

- **Misaligned problem selection**: Public attention targets protein binding prediction. Experienced drug hunters know these problems don't block real discovery campaigns.

- **Decision-making automation wins**: ML synthesizes data into actionable decisions, cutting time spent discussing uncertainty without reaching conclusions.

- **Rote process optimization pays off**: ML handles hit prioritization, protein design optimization, retrosynthetic pathway prediction, and robotic management. Lower-order tasks, but they matter.

- **Organization beats algorithms**: Data-centric cultures with engineering discipline determine success. Build on existing scientific expertise.

- **Enhance, don't replace**: Success comes from improving proven drug-making organizations. Engineering-first approaches alone don't generate pharmaceuticals.

## Who Should Read This

- **Biotech investors** evaluating AI drug discovery companies and determining where to allocate capital
- **CTOs and CSOs** deciding which AI capabilities to build, buy, or partner for
- **AI for bio researchers** seeking to understand where their skills can deliver maximum impact
- **Pharmaceutical researchers** navigating the hype around AI-enabled drug development
- **Startup founders** building AI-native biotech companies

## Real-World Evidence

Leash Bio's binding prediction contest attracted 1,950 teams. Results were underwhelming. Major computational biotech firms didn't participate - they know where value actually lives.

Practical ML applications that work today include:
- Hit prioritization from high-throughput screening data
- Few-shot protein design for optimization
- Hit expansion and maturation
- Retrosynthetic pathway prediction
- Autonomous robotic management of experiments
- mRNA sequence design and optimization

## The Five-Minute Insight Problem

Experienced teams extract maximum insights from data in minutes. Analysis runs fast. Decision-making drags. Scientists spend hours discussing results instead of acting on them. AI/ML systems that turn data into clear recommendations accelerate decisions.

## The Bottom Line

Reject techno-optimism and biological determinism. AI for bio scientists should improve established drug discovery processes with interpretable, model-driven decision systems. Understand existing workflows deeply before automating them. Revolutionary breakthroughs come later.
