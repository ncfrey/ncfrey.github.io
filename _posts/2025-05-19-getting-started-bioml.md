## Executive Summary

Breaking into AI for Bio takes 1-5 years: solid fundamentals, meaningful research experience, demonstrated execution, and strong engineering practices. Pedigree matters less than what you've built and shipped.

## Key Insights for Aspiring AI for Bio Researchers

- **Foundation over specialization**: Study CS, Applied Math, and physical sciences. Compete on fundamentals, absorb biology through enthusiasm and papers. "Biology is more a question of enthusiasm and fear than of knowledge."

- **Velocity beats perfection**: Iteration speed dominates in empirical research. Complete one year-long project with clear outcomes. Half-finished prototypes teach you less.

- **Engineering discipline multiplies impact**: Well-organized, documented code enables collaboration. Messy implementations block progress. Engineers won't fix your code for you.

- **High agency separates candidates**: Identify meaningful problems independently. Solve them proactively. Top researchers don't wait for assignments.

- **Network before you need to**: Build relationships with researchers and hiring managers through conferences and cold emails. Start before job searching.

## Who This Guide Is For

- **Undergraduate and graduate students** considering AI for bio careers
- **Postdocs and early-career researchers** transitioning into AI for bio
- **Job seekers** exploring startups, biotechs, or pharmaceutical companies
- **Self-taught individuals** supplementing formal education
- **Bootcamp graduates** looking to enter the field

## What Hiring Managers Actually Look For

When I review candidates for AI for bio positions, I look for three things:

1. **Evidence of completed work** - Did you finish something meaningful?
2. **Problem-solving agency** - Can you identify and solve problems independently?
3. **Collaborative potential** - Can you work effectively with biologists, chemists, and engineers?

Pedigree matters less than execution. I explicitly welcome candidates from underrepresented backgrounds and value diverse perspectives.

## Application Materials That Matter

**Essential:**
- **Writing sample** - Research proposal or technical explanation demonstrating clear thinking
- **GitHub repository** - Clean, documented code showing engineering quality
- **Published work** - Paper, preprint, or substantial technical blog post

**Less Important:**
- Prestigious university name
- Perfect GPA
- Extensive biology coursework (for computational roles)

## Recommended Learning Path

### Core Fundamentals (6-12 months)
- **Machine Learning:** Kyunghyun Cho's 2025 ML Lecture Notes, Kevin Patrick Murphy's Probabilistic Machine Learning
- **Biology:** Enthusiasm + reading papers > formal coursework
- **Programming:** Python, version control (Git), testing, documentation
- **Math:** Linear algebra, probability, optimization

### Practical Skills (12-24 months)
- **Cheminformatics:** Pat Walter's Practical Cheminformatics tutorials
- **Protein modeling:** AlphaFold, ESMFold, structure prediction tools
- **Data analysis:** Pandas, visualization, statistical testing
- **Scientific computing:** Jupyter notebooks, experiment tracking, reproducibility

### Research Experience (12-36 months)
- **Publish a project:** Start to finish, with results and writeup
- **Collaborate:** Work with experimentalists or other computational scientists
- **Present your work:** Conferences, lab meetings, blog posts

## The Reality Check

This takes 1-5 years. Long-term career investment. The world needs your contribution - more important problems than people to solve them.

## Practical Next Steps

1. **Pick one foundational resource** and work through it completely
2. **Identify one research problem** you find interesting
3. **Build one small project** demonstrating your skills
4. **Share your work** (GitHub, blog post, preprint)
5. **Attend one conference** and introduce yourself to researchers
6. **Send cold emails** to 5-10 researchers whose work you admire

Don't wait for permission. Start building.
